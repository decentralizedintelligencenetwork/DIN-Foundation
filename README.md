# Welcome to the Doctelligence Foundation 🚀

The Doctelligence Foundation supports and promotes the core values of the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN). Our mission is to advocate for a self-sovereign, decentralized ecosystem that empowers individuals and organizations through data sovereignty, scalable AI, and advanced decentralized technologies. We aim to drive innovation and ensure accessibility across various industries.

## Key Principles Supported by Doctelligence Foundation:
- 🛡️ **Advocate for a self-sovereign, decentralized network** that fosters trust and autonomy across multiple sectors.
- 📈 **Promote access to federated learning (FL) protocols** for open and decentralized AI ecosystems.
- 🌍 **Encourage an ecosystem where data contributions are rewarded,** fostering innovation and equity.

The Doctelligence Foundation is dedicated to supporting the principles of decentralization and enhancing industry outcomes by aligning with global standards and frameworks. We focus on advancing digital technologies and their applications to ensure accessibility, equity, and innovation.

## Origins and Vision:
The Doctelligence Foundation’s framework is built upon pioneering research in decentralized and privacy-preserving technologies. Our vision was showcased at the Summit on Responsible Decentralized Intelligence - Future of Decentralization and AI, hosted by Berkeley RDI on August 6, 2024, at the Verizon Center, Cornell Tech Campus, Roosevelt Island, NYC.
